% CELL SENSOR

/* sensor(+Sensor_type,+Detected_event)
	It suceeds if a sensor of Sensor_type, which must be passed instantiated, has detected an event of a given type
	(which must be passed instantiated, too). 

	Types of sensors are exclusively the following:
	- cell (to detect the type of cell the robot is over)
	- temp (to detect the temperature)
	- prox (to detect proximity to an obstacle)
	- light (to detect the type of the cell just in front of the robot)
	- batt (to detect the state of the battery).

	Type of events for each sensor are as follows:
	- For cell: 	base --> robot is on the base, i.e., recharging
			black --> robot is on  black square (path to the recharge station)
			normal --> robot is on a usual cell.
	- For temp:	equal --> robot is on the base, and therefore the temperature is as before
			up --> robot is either in front of the base or looking at the fire.
			down --> robot is back to the fire
	- For prox:	true --> robot is just in front of either, an obstacle or a wall
			false --> there is nothing solid (either obstacle or wall) in front of the robot.
	- For light:	dark --> the cell in front of the robot is either a wall or a black cell (path to the recharge station)
			bright --> the robot is in front of the fire
			normal --> none of the situations above
	- For batt:	high --> up to 10 time steps have elapsed since last recharge
			medium --> between 11 and 29 steps have elapsed since last recharge
			low --> between 30 and 50 steps have elapsed since last recharge
			dead --> 50 or more cycles have elapsed since last recharge. The robot can't move anymore.

	Atomic actions allowed for this robot are:

	- turnR: It changes the direction of advance of the robot making it turn 90 degrees to the right. This consumes one battery cycle.
	- fwd: It changes the position of the robot making it advance one cell in its current direction of advance.
		If the robot is touching a wall or an obstacle, it does not move. This consumes one battery cycle IN ANY CASE.
	- put-out: It extinguishes the fire but only if it is just in front of the robot. This consumes four battery cycles.
